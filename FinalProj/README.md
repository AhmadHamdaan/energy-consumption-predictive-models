World Energy Consumption Predictive Model
README
Project Overview
This project predicts the global electricity demand from 2016 to 2025 based on historical energy consumption data. The model uses linear regression to predict electricity demand per country and aggregates these predictions to forecast global totals. The project involves data cleaning, training individual models for each country, and visualizing the predictions alongside historical demand.

Features
Predicts electricity demand for individual countries from 2016 to 2025.

Aggregates predictions to forecast global electricity demand for the same period.

Evaluates global prediction model performance using historical data.

Visualizes global electricity demand with key insights, including CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), peak, and minimum forecast years.

Compares predictions to actuals (2016â€“2022).
